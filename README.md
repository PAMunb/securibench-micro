Securibench Micro (Upgrade)
=================

This is a fork of Securibench Micro repository https://github.com/too4words/securibench-micro and its main goals is to upgrade the way "servlets" are handle.

We haved moved from **javax servlet api** to **Jakarta servlet** and in order not to lost the old code we have versioned it in two folders.


***src/securibench/v1***: contents the test suite using **javax servlet api**

***src/securibench/v2***: contents the test suite using **Jakarta servlet** (upgraded)
